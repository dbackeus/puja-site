        Please note that your reservation will need
        to be paid before it is confirmed. If you have requested accommodation
        in the cabins or hostel the places left may run out if you take too long
        to pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to pay later you can find the link back to this page in the
        confirmation email we sent to you.

      <h3>Payment</h3>
      <p>
        To cover the cost of the puja we have decided to use a "pay what you want"
        model, while making sure we can at least cover the minimum cost of participation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The minimum cost includes accomodation and food for the weekend.
        However there are many other costs for organizing the puja,
        totalling about 10 000 EUR. To cover this we ask that you add a donation
        on top of the minimum.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope this way
        those who do not have a steady income, such as students, or those coming
        from countries with a weaker economy can still come to enjoy the puja,
        while those who earn more can excercise their generosity from their hearts.
      </p>
